Adding authentication to laravel project
In terminal:
$ composer require laravel/ui --dev
$ php artisan ui vue (or bootstrap) --auth
$ npm install && npm run dev

Routing
1. web.php returns a controller to view on the webpage    //Route::get('/home', [App\Http\Controllers\HomeController::class, 'index'])->name('home');
2. this goes to the HomeController and runs that code
3.  The first code that runs is public function __construct() which runs $this->middleware('auth');
    - This makes sure the user is authorized before showing the page
4. If the user is authorized, they can login.


Flow if a user forgets his password:
1. CLick 'Forgot Password"
2. Fill out a form with their email address.
3. Prepare a unique token and associate it with the users's account
4. Send an email with a unique link back to our site that confirms email ownership
5. Link back to the website, conform the token, set a new password
